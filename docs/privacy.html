    <h2>3. Screen Time and Family Controls</h2>
    <p>NoMo Phone uses Apple's Screen Time APIs (DeviceActivityMonitor, ManagedSettings) to provide its core functionality. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What We Access</strong>: We detect when your device screen is off or when you're not actively using apps, allowing us to measure focus time.</li>
        <li><strong>What We Do NOT Access</strong>: We cannot see which specific apps you use, your browsing history, or any content within apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: Screen Time detection happens entirely on your device. Focus session durations are stored locally and synced to your account if you're signed in.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Control</strong>: You can revoke Screen Time access at any time through iOS Settings > Screen Time > NoMo Phone.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Most of your data (focus sessions, pet state, coins) is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: If you create an account, your progress is synced to our secure cloud servers (hosted on Supabase) to enable cross-device access and backup.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: All data transmitted to our servers is encrypted using industry-standard TLS encryption.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention</strong>: We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. You can request deletion at any time.</li>
