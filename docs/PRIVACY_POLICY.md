**Last Updated: January 26, 2025**
**Effective Date: December 3, 2024**

NoMo Inc. ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the NoMo Phone mobile application (the "App").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide

- **Account Information**: If you create an account, we collect your email address and user ID for authentication and account management purposes.
- **In-App Purchases**: When you make purchases, Apple processes your payment. We receive confirmation of your subscription status but do not have access to your payment details.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically

- **Screen Time Data**: With your explicit permission, we access iOS Screen Time APIs (Family Controls) to detect when you are away from your phone. This data is used solely to calculate focus session duration and award in-app rewards. We do not access which specific apps you use, and this data never leaves your device.
- **Focus Session Data**: We collect information about your focus sessions, including duration, streaks, and completion status to provide app functionality and track your progress.
- **Device Identifier**: We collect a device identifier to sync your data across sessions and provide app functionality. This is not used for tracking or advertising.

### 1.3 Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** track which specific apps you use
- We do **not** sell your personal information to third parties
- We do **not** use your data for advertising or cross-app tracking
- We do **not** share your Screen Time data with any third parties

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- **Provide Core Functionality**: Track your focus sessions and calculate time spent away from your phone
- **Award Rewards**: Provide in-app coins and rewards based on your focus achievements
- **Sync Progress**: Maintain your focus streaks, pet care progress, and virtual world state
- **Process Purchases**: Verify and manage your subscription status
- **Improve the App**: Understand usage patterns to improve features (using aggregated, anonymized data only)
- **Send Notifications**: Remind you of focus goals or streak maintenance (only if you opt in)

## 3. Screen Time and Family Controls

NoMo Phone uses Apple's Screen Time APIs (DeviceActivityMonitor, ManagedSettings) to provide its core functionality. Specifically:

- **What We Access**: We detect when your device screen is off or when you're not actively using apps, allowing us to measure focus time.
- **What We Do NOT Access**: We cannot see which specific apps you use, your browsing history, or any content within apps.
- **Data Storage**: Screen Time detection happens entirely on your device. Focus session durations are stored locally and synced to your account if you're signed in.
- **Your Control**: You can revoke Screen Time access at any time through iOS Settings > Screen Time > NoMo Phone.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: Most of your data (focus sessions, pet state, coins) is stored locally on your device.
- **Cloud Sync**: If you create an account, your progress is synced to our secure cloud servers (hosted on Supabase) to enable cross-device access and backup.
- **Encryption**: All data transmitted to our servers is encrypted using industry-standard TLS encryption.
- **Retention**: We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. You can request deletion at any time.

## 5. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

- **Apple StoreKit**: For processing in-app purchases and subscriptions. Apple's privacy policy applies to payment processing.
- **Supabase**: For secure cloud data storage and authentication. Data is stored in compliance with industry security standards.
- **Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)**: For optional push notifications. Notification preferences are controlled through iOS Settings.
- **Error Reporting (Sentry)**: We use a minimal error reporting service to help us identify and fix app crashes and bugs. This service only collects technical error information (such as crash logs and error messages) and does not collect personal data, browsing history, or usage patterns. Error reporting is used solely for app stability improvements.

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
