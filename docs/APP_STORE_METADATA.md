## Review Notes for App Review Team

NoMo Phone uses Apple's Screen Time APIs (DeviceActivityMonitor, ManagedSettings) to:
1. Detect when the user puts their phone down (screen off detection)
2. Optionally block distracting apps during focus sessions (with user consent)

Key testing notes:
- Screen Time features require a physical device (not simulator)
- The app will request Screen Time authorization on first focus session
- In-app purchases can be tested with sandbox accounts
- Push notifications are optional and require user permission

Demo account (optional):
Email: demo@nomoinc.co
Password: [To be provided separately]

All content is original pixel art created for this application.
