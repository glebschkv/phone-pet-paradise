## 2. Competitor Pricing Analysis

### Direct Competitors (Virtual Pet Apps)

| App | Monthly Sub | Annual Sub | Cheapest IAP | Highest IAP | Model |
|-----|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| My Talking Tom | $4.99 (Game Squad) | -- | $0.99 | $99.99 | Free + IAP + Ads |
| My Talking Tom 2 | -- | -- | $0.99 | $99.99 | Free + IAP + Ads, $14.99 remove ads |
| Neko Atsume 2 | $0.99-$2.99 (3 tiers) | -- | $0.99 | $4.99 | Free + Light IAP |
| My Tamagotchi Forever | $5.00 (ad-free) | -- | $1.99 | $99.99 | Free + IAP + Ads |
| Pou | -- | -- | $0.99 | $74.99 | Free + IAP |
| Cat Sim Online | $9.99/week | -- | -- | -- | Aggressive sub |

### Key Takeaways

- **Our Premium at $4.99/mo is in line** with Talking Tom's Game Squad ($4.99) and Tamagotchi Forever's ad-free tier ($5.00).
- **Our Premium+ at $8.99/mo has no direct competitor analog** in the pet space -- this is differentiation, but also uncharted territory for willingness-to-pay.
- **We lack a $99.99 IAP tier** that every major competitor offers.
- **Neko Atsume 2 added subscriptions** to its sequel (the original had none), confirming the industry trend toward subscriptions even in gentle/casual pet games.
- **Most competitors rely heavily on ad revenue** alongside IAP. Our ad strategy (if any) is separate from this analysis.

### Indirect Competitors (Productivity/Focus Apps)

Since NoMo is also a productivity app, these comparisons matter:

| App | Monthly | Annual | Lifetime |
|-----|---------|--------|----------|
| Forest | -- | -- | $3.99 (one-time) |
| Flora | Free / $1.99 IAP | -- | -- |
| Focus Plant | $4.99 | $19.99 | -- |
| Habitica | $4.99 | $47.99 | -- |

- Our subscription pricing is **at the high end for productivity apps** but justified by the pet/gamification layer.
- Forest's one-time $3.99 model is much simpler but limits revenue per user.

## 4. Gap Analysis

### What We're Doing Well

| Area | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Two-tier subscription model | Aligned with industry best practice for upselling |
| Annual discount (33-40%) | Matches the recommended 30-40% range |
| Lifetime tier as price anchor | Textbook anchoring psychology |
| 5-tier coin pack ladder | Standard structure |
| Starter bundles with exclusive pets | Proven first-purchase driver |
| Battle pass at $4.99/$9.99 | On-market pricing |
| Subscription includes bonus coins | Adds immediate tangible value |

### Gaps and Concerns

| Issue | Detail | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **No $99.99 coin pack** | Missing the whale-tier anchor that makes $49.99 feel reasonable. Every major competitor has this. | HIGH |
| **$0.99 starter pack may be too cheap** | Industry data shows raising the minimum IAP from $0.99 to $2.99-$4.99 can increase revenue 3-5x with only modest conversion drop. The $0.99 tier trains users to expect ultra-cheap purchases. | HIGH |
| **Coin value scaling is weak** | The $/coin only improves ~50% from cheapest to most expensive pack ($0.00165 to $0.00083). Top games offer 100-200% improvement to incentivize larger purchases. | MEDIUM |
| **Lifetime at $149.99 is slightly low** | At 2.3x the Premium+ annual price, it's below the recommended 2.5-3x multiplier. Risk: users buy lifetime too early, capping LTV. | MEDIUM |
| **Premium+ monthly ($8.99) lacks clear comparison** | No direct competitor charges this in the pet space. Needs strong value justification or risks feeling overpriced. | MEDIUM |
| **Battle Pass is disabled** | 41% of top-grossing games use season passes. This is leaving money on the table. | HIGH |
| **No remove-ads IAP** | If running ads, a $4.99-$9.99 one-time "remove ads" is proven easy revenue. | LOW |
| **No dynamic/contextual pricing** | The industry is moving to personalized offers. Static pricing leaves optimization on the table. | LOW (future) |
| **Coin packs don't actually credit coins** | Critical bug: purchases charge users but coins are never granted (receipt validation doesn't handle coin product IDs). | CRITICAL |

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 Subscription Pricing: KEEP CURRENT PRICES (minor adjustments)

**Verdict: No change to base subscription prices.**

Our subscription prices are well-positioned:
- **Premium at $4.99/mo** matches Talking Tom and Tamagotchi. Moving to $5.99 would put us above direct competitors without adding value.
- **Premium+ at $8.99/mo** is a reasonable upsell at 1.8x the base tier. The included battle pass justifies the premium.
- **Annual pricing** at 33-40% discount is industry-standard.

**Recommended adjustment:**
- **Increase Lifetime from $149.99 to $179.99.** This moves the lifetime-to-annual ratio from 2.3x to 2.8x (within the recommended 2.5-3x range), generates more revenue from committed users, and makes the annual plan look like better value by comparison. A $149.99 lifetime is borderline "too cheap" -- users who buy it early cap their LTV significantly.

### 5.2 Coin Packs: RESTRUCTURE

**Current problem:** The value curve is too flat and missing a top-end anchor.

**Recommended new structure:**

| Pack | Price | Coins | Bonus | Total | $/Coin | Change |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| ~~Starter~~ | ~~$0.99~~ | -- | -- | -- | -- | **REMOVE** |
| Handful | $2.99 | 1,000 | +200 | 1,200 | $0.00249 | New entry point |
| Pouch | $4.99 | 2,000 | +500 | 2,500 | $0.00200 | Replaces Value |
| Chest | $9.99 | 5,000 | +1,500 | 6,500 | $0.00154 | Replaces Premium |
| Vault | $24.99 | 15,000 | +5,000 | 20,000 | $0.00125 | Replaces Mega |
| Treasure | $49.99 | 40,000 | +15,000 | 55,000 | $0.00091 | Replaces Ultra |
| **Royal Hoard** | **$99.99** | **100,000** | **+50,000** | **150,000** | **$0.00067** | **NEW anchor** |

**Key changes:**
1. **Remove $0.99 tier.** Research shows this trains users to spend minimally. The $2.99 entry point is the conversion sweet spot.
2. **Add $99.99 anchor tier.** This makes $49.99 look reasonable and captures whale spending. Every top-grossing competitor has this.
3. **Steeper value curve.** The $/coin now improves ~3.7x from cheapest to most expensive (vs. current ~2x), strongly incentivizing larger purchases.

### 5.3 Starter Bundles: KEEP WITH ONE ADJUSTMENT

**Verdict: Current bundle structure is strong.** Exclusive pets + coins + utility is a proven formula.

**One change:**
- **Remove or reprice the $1.99 Welcome Gift.** At $1.99 with only 400 coins, it competes with the new $2.99 Handful coin pack but offers less value per dollar in pure coins. Either:
  - **(A)** Raise to $2.99 and increase contents (600 coins + Focus Boost + 2 Streak Freezes), or
  - **(B)** Keep at $1.99 but reposition as a one-time-only "first purchase" offer with a clear exclusive reward (e.g., a unique cosmetic item).

### 5.4 Battle Pass: ENABLE AND KEEP PRICING

**Verdict: Enable the battle pass immediately.** 41% of top-grossing games use season passes, and yours is already built.

- **$4.99 for premium track** is standard.
- **$9.99 for premium + 10 tiers** is standard.
- The fact that Premium+ includes the battle pass is excellent value differentiation.

### 5.5 Coin Boosters: KEEP CURRENT PRICES

| Booster | Coin Price | IAP Price | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Focus Boost (2x, 1 day) | 200 | $0.99 | Fair |
| Super Boost (3x, 3 days) | 500 | $2.99 | Fair |
| Weekly Pass (1.5x, 7 days) | 800 | $4.99 | Fair |

These are well-positioned. The dual currency (coins OR IAP) pricing gives flexibility.

### 5.6 In-Game Coin Prices: NO CHANGE NEEDED

Pet prices (800-5,000 coins), backgrounds (600-2,000 coins), and utility items (150-800 coins) are reasonable relative to earn rates (1 coin/minute base, with multipliers).

A free user earns ~60 coins/hour. Buying the cheapest pet (800 coins) takes ~13 hours of focus time. This is a good engagement driver that makes IAP attractive without feeling mandatory.

## Summary of Recommended Changes

|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Lifetime price | $149.99 | $179.99 | Move to 2.8x annual ratio (from 2.3x) |

| $99.99 coin pack | Missing | Add (150,000 coins) | Anchor pricing, capture whale segment |
| Coin value curve | ~2x improvement | ~3.7x improvement | Incentivize larger purchases |
| Welcome Gift bundle | $1.99 | $2.99 (with more contents) | Align with new minimum IAP floor |
| Battle Pass | Disabled | Enable | 41% of top games use this; already built |

### Changes NOT Recommended

| Item | Current | Keep Because |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Premium monthly | $4.99 | Matches direct competitors (Talking Tom, Tamagotchi) |
| Premium+ monthly | $8.99 | Reasonable upsell with battle pass included |
| Annual discounts | 33-40% | Industry standard |
| Starter bundles | $4.99-$29.99 | Strong structure with exclusive pets |
| Battle pass pricing | $4.99/$9.99 | On-market |
| Coin boosters | $0.99-$4.99 | Well-positioned |
| In-game coin prices | 150-5,000 | Good balance of earn vs. buy |

## Critical Bug: Fix Before Any Pricing Changes

**Coin pack purchases do not credit coins to users.** The `validate-receipt` edge function (`/supabase/functions/validate-receipt/index.ts`) does not handle coin product IDs. Users are charged real money but receive nothing. This must be fixed before any coin pack restructuring.
